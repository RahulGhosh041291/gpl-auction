# Delete Player API Fix

## Issue
The delete player API was returning a 500 status code due to a foreign key constraint violation.

### Error Details
```
psycopg2.errors.ForeignKeyViolation: update or delete on table "players" violates foreign key constraint "auctions_current_player_id_fkey" on table "auctions"
DETAIL:  Key (id)=(1) is still referenced from table "auctions".
```

## Root Cause
The `players` table has a foreign key relationship with the `auctions` table through the `current_player_id` column. When attempting to delete a player that is currently set as the `current_player_id` in an auction, the database prevents the deletion to maintain referential integrity.

The original delete function:
1. Checked if player is SOLD (prevented deletion)
2. Deleted associated bids
3. Deleted the player

But it didn't handle the case where the player might be referenced in the `auctions` table as `current_player_id`.

## Solution

Updated the `delete_player` endpoint in `backend/routers/players.py` to:
1. Check if player is SOLD (prevent deletion)
2. **Clear any auction references to this player** (NEW)
3. Delete associated bids
4. Delete the player

### Code Changes

```python
@router.delete("/{player_id}")
async def delete_player(
    player_id: int, 
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_admin_user)
):
    """Delete a player (Admin only)"""
    from models import Auction
    
    player = db.query(PlayerModel).filter(PlayerModel.id == player_id).first()
    if not player:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Player not found")
    
    if player.status == PlayerStatus.SOLD:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Cannot delete a sold player")
    
    # Clear any auction references to this player
    db.query(Auction).filter(Auction.current_player_id == player_id).update({
        "current_player_id": None,
        "current_bid_amount": None,
        "current_bidding_team_id": None
    })
    
    # Delete all bids associated with this player
    db.query(Bid).filter(Bid.player_id == player_id).delete()
    
    # Now delete the player
    db.delete(player)
    db.commit()
    return {"message": "Player deleted successfully"}
```

## Deployment

- ✅ Code committed: `a005b49`
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Render auto-deployment triggered
- ✅ Backend health check passed

## Testing

To test the fix:

```bash
curl 'https://gpl-auction-backend.onrender.com/api/players/{player_id}' \
  -X 'DELETE' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer {YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Expected response (200 OK):
```json
{
  "message": "Player deleted successfully"
}
```

## Notes

- The fix ensures that any auction currently referencing the player will have its `current_player_id`, `current_bid_amount`, and `current_bidding_team_id` cleared before the player is deleted
- Players with status SOLD still cannot be deleted (business logic protection)
- All bids associated with the player are also deleted as part of the cleanup
- Admin authentication is required for this operation

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
